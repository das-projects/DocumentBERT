# ERGO MLOps Repository and Guide

**This is a work-in-progress!**

## How to use this Repository

The contents of the repository are **not** intended to be a template that every new project needs to copy.
New projects should have the same folder structure and pick and choose what they need from this repository to fulfill their needs.
In addition, the code examples in this repository are deliberately simple and do not cover the full complexity of a real use case.
They are inteded to showcase the *kind* of logic that needs to be implemented.
Example projects and starter templates will be created at a later time.

You can read up on important topics in the sections linked below or browse the source code in this repository.
Most code examples are heavily commented and give hints about how to achieve certain tasks with SageMaker services.
